              <p style="float: left">This is the story of our first trip together and by the way the first I write in this blog.
                Iguana & Iguanodon together in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Back then, we had decided to run away from
                the cold weather of Europe and enjoy the warm wind of Egypt. It was autumn. I like that season,
                it’s quite romantic let’s say… Trees changing colors, leaves
                all around falling down slowly… well, well, let’s be serious, autumn can likely bring a really bad weather to Germany, especially if we get these storms coming from Rusia or Scandinavia, brrr …   
                Swedish say: There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes. _(。_°/
                <br><p></p>
                Maybe it’s me and my poor wardrobe but the bright warm sunlight is one of the greatest pleasure in life, I think.
                So, we found a nice offer from Nürnberg to Sharm El Sheikh, about 500EUR/8 days-All Inclusive and I mean, all inclusive.
                (Flight, hotel and whatever you wanted to eat and drink) Not a bad deal eh? We read the offer first at L’TUR,
                then we did our search online. We search on Swoodoo and Kayak but this was the best last minute offer, pretty made for us. So we took it!
                <br><p></p>
                Sharm El Sheik is a city on the southern part of Egypt on the Sinai Peninsula along the Red Sea.
                Before 1967, this city was just more than an occasional base of operations for local fishermen.
                Then, the Israelis converted the perfect spot for massive tourism and build up hotels, diving clubs, etc. Well, the message here is, once you get there, you feel yourself warmly welcomed by mass tourism. 
                <br><p></p>
                Everything in there is prepared for spoiled tourists from all kind of budgets.
                We didn’t see any tourist there backpacking or travelling on its own. Everything was prepared, organized and they even speak German!
                I mean this is not a plus for me, I barely can survive with my German but definitely a plus for my Iguanodon. (•ө•)♡ 
                <br><p></p>
                As soon as you get down the flight, you find yourself in a large line for the VISA and then in a large line
                for the shuttle and then the line for the Hotel registration, and so on… 
                <br><p></p>
                We considered ourselves all terrain tourists, but this was kind of exaggerated.
                Well, all in all it wasn’t that bad, in the end we liked it and anyway it was as sunny and warm as we imagined.
                The water was also really warm and we could feel a little bit of the magic of Egypt even though we had to queue for that! σ(^○^)
